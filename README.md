# react-native-js-api-bridge

React Native proof-of-concept to dynamically bridge any Android API to JS.

## Details

See [this blog post](http://blog.xebia.com/generic-js-android-api-wrapper-for-react-native)
for the proof-of-concept explanation.

## Run it

Make sure you installed the React Native CLI:

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

If you haven't setup any Android stuff yet, install [Android Studio 2](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and let it download the Android SDK and default emulator image for you. Then, start up the emulator from Android Studio.

Clone this repo and run from the project dir:

```bash
npm install
```

and then run the app:

```bash
react-native run-android
```
